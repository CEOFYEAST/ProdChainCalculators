## Production Chain
A series of one or more outputs and inputs; always ends in an output whose demand is generated by the user

## Production Chain Data
The data representation of a production chain; contains user demand data and intermediary demand data for every item in the production chain

## Production Chain Object
Contains a production chain data object, as well as the time unit of the production chain

## Time Unit
The time period that item demand is framed in; for example, if a production chain has a demand of 60 inserters, and the time unit of the production chain is "minute", then that production chain would require 60 inserters per minute

## Items Required Per Time Unit (IRPTU) 
The unit that represents the number of a specific item demanded by a production chain per unit of time

## Recipes Object
Central to the package, the recipes object contains data pertaining to the construction of every item in the game. Each item in the game has its own entry, and each entry contains data on how to make that item. The "ingredients", or constituent items required to make each item, are included, as well as their ratios. Other data, such as the item yield per craft of each recipe, is also listed.

The recipes object also happens to be the only data source used by the package that stores any info about the items being used; therefore, the IDs and names of valid items to be added or removed from the production chain are pulled directly from this object.

The package doesn't explicitly support usage of other recipe objects, but it doesn't prevent it either. The server can just serve different recipe objects, as long as they're in the proper format.
