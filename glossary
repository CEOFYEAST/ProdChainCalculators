## Production Chain
A series of one or more outputs and inputs; always ends in an output whose demand is generated by the user

## Production Chain Data
The data representation of a production chain; contains user demand data and intermediary demand data for every item in the production chain

## Production Chain Object
Contains a production chain data object, as well as the time unit of the production chain

## Time Unit
The time period that item demand is framed in; for example, if a production chain has a demand of 60 inserters, and the time unit of the production chain is "minute", then that production chain would require 60 inserters per minute

## Items Required Per Time Unit (IRPTU) 
The unit that represents the number of a specific item demanded by a production chain per unit of time
