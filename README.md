# Production Chain Calculators

A package used to create, modify, and parse data representations of production chains from Factorio factories

## Summary

Functionality of the package is exported through two main modules, irptu (at prodchaincalculators/irptu) and utility (at prodchaincalculators/utility). The irptu module exposes methods to add and subtract user demand for individual items from a production chain; the demand for the intermediary items required to make said item is updated accordingly. The utility module exposes methods to create, parse, and recalculate a production chain.
